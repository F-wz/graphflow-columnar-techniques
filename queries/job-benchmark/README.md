# JOB Benchmark queries for GraphflowDB CL and RV

This folder contains the exact queries that we use for benchmarking the IMDb 2013 dataset. We benchmark only the A variant of each of 33 queries with minimal required modifications to run on GraphflowDB.

Original paper defining the JOB Benchmark and queries can be found [here](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/lookingglass.pdf). 

SQL versions of the queries as well as the original IMDb dataset can be found [here](https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/papers/lookingglass.pdf).
